# mazes

random maze generation and solving using python

mazes are created using a randomised depth-first algorithm. solving uses the a* pathfinding algorithm.

a small note for the png generation command, an *n x n* maze will create an *(n x 2 + 1) x (n x 2 + 1)* png, due to the fact that walls don't inhabit space in the maze model, and extra space has to be used to visualise the walls.
